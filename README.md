# TheExerciseProject

This project was my first project done using React.js. It combines some preminlary aspects of fitness and combines each feature into a single functional application

## BMI Calculator

The first tool in this application features a body mass index tool. It takes a user's height(cm) and weight(lbs) and will return a message that indicates the number correpsonding tho their BMI.

## Exercises
The second tool is a random exercise generator. Users are able to select the muscle group they want to train and a set of exercises will be printed with reps and number of sets. 


## Meals

The third tool is a random meal generator. Similar to the exercise generator, this will allow users to choose between a vegetarian or non-vegetarian meal that is printed to the screen.

## Tech Stack
